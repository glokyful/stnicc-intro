the sources are not really the one at stniccc, the init dezinit of the systeme
is not done, so the return to gem is bad, i know it's tragedie
CERC6B.S is the source for dots you can assemble it if you set standalone equ 1
and do much more dots, without the ydisting scroll, 3PIXGL3.S can be run as 
standalone also, with the same thing, merge2.s is the demo itself
set eventually no case sensitive on
